# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is a project for the curriculum of The-Odin-Project!

It involves the creation of a grid that you can use as an etch-a-sketch!
This project highlights and focuses on the skills of DOM manipulation, the use of flex-box and problem-solving skills to achieve cool features like dynamic sizing of the squares of the grid on the spot!
